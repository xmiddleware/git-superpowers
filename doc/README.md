## 💡 CORE TEACHING FRAMEWORK

### The Journey (What You're Creating):
```
Entry: Fear ("I might break Git forever")
↓
Recognition: "Git is actually safe"
↓
Proof: Live recovery demonstrations
↓
Empowerment: Six tools to handle any situation
↓
Exit: Confidence ("I can't break anything anymore")
```

### Key Statements (Use Often):
- "Git is not dangerous."
- "Nothing is ever truly lost."
- "If it's committed, it's recoverable."
- "You control Git now. Not the other way around."
- "Mistakes are learning opportunities."

---

## 🆘 COMMON QUESTIONS

**Q: What if a demo breaks?**
A: Use git reflog to fix it live. Say "Perfect teaching moment!" Audience sees recovery.

**Q: What if someone asks about merge/rebase?**
A: "Great question. That's advanced. Today we focus on foundations."

**Q: What if I fall behind on timing?**
A: Skip cherry-pick demo, keep reflog. Demos are modular.

**Q: Do I need to compile the Java code?**
A: No. Demos are about Git, not Java. Code is just example files.

**Q: What if Git isn't installed?**
A: Install before: `brew install git` (macOS) or `sudo apt-get install git` (Linux)
