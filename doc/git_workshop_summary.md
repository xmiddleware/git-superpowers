## 🆘 TROUBLESHOOTING QUICK ANSWERS

|---------|--------|
| "Demo didn't work" | Use git reflog to recover and show it |
| "I forgot which demo is next" | Look at git_quick_reference.md |
| "Someone asks about merge/rebase" | "Great Q. That's advanced. Today = foundations" |
| "Audience looks confused" | Pause, repeat concept with different words, show git log |
| "Terminal text too small" | Cmd/Ctrl + Plus many times |
| "I made a mistake" | "Perfect teaching moment!" Recover with reflog |
| "Timer says I'm behind" | Skip cherry-pick, keep reflog demo |
| "Someone asks Git history" | "It's stored in .git folder, encrypted and backed up" |

## 🎯 YOUR ROLE (Three Parts)

### Part 1: Technical Expert
- You know Git deeply
- You run demos flawlessly
- You answer questions precisely
- You use the tools confidently

### Part 2: Educator
- You explain complex concepts simply
- You repeat key points
- You connect to their reality
- You help them understand, not just learn

### Part 3: Confidence Builder

## 💪 CONFIDENCE STATEMENTS

Use these liberally throughout the workshop:

1. "Git is not dangerous."
2. "Nothing is ever truly lost."
3. "If it's committed, it's recoverable."
4. "This is version control. Control is the keyword."
5. "Mistakes are learning opportunities."
6. "You cannot break anything that matters."
7. "Git is forgiving. I'm about to prove it."
8. "Local branches are yours—break them fearlessly."
9. "Shared branches are everyone's—be careful there."
10. "You control Git now. Not the other way around."

---

## 📞 SUPPORT / QUESTIONS

### During Workshop:
- **Technical question:** Improvise or defer to Q&A ("Great Q, let's explore that")
- **Real problem:** Use git reflog to recover, show audience
- **Off-topic question:** Acknowledge, redirect ("That's fascinating, let's talk after")

### After Workshop:
- **Follow-up email:** Share reference materials, thank them
- **Someone says they're still scared:** Offer 1-on-1 demo
- **Someone wants advanced content:** "Let's do 'Advanced Git' next workshop"

## 🎁 WHAT YOU'RE ACTUALLY GIVING THEM

This isn't just a Git workshop.

You're giving them:
- **Permission to experiment** (without fear)
- **Confidence in their tools** (not just knowledge)
- **Peace of mind** (nothing breaks permanently)

That's powerful. Own it.
